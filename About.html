              <h1><strong>Hi, I'm Junu Kasim</strong></h1>
              <p>
                An engineer with over seven years of experience in the
                semiconductor industry, including four years specializing in
                physical design. My career journey has taken me through diverse
                roles and projects, from hands-on tapeouts at advanced
                technology nodes to academic research and design exploration.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most recently, I completed my Master’s degree in Integrated
                Circuits and Systems Design, where I deepened my expertise in
                both analog and digital design. During this program, I gained
                extensive hands-on experience through practical labs using
                industry-standard EDA tools. The curriculum offered me a solid
                foundation in mixed-signal design, covering full-custom analog
                layout, gate-level digital design in VHDL, and system-level
                modeling.
              </p>
              <p>
                For my Master’s thesis, I had the opportunity to work with
                Infineon Technologies, investigating a state-of-the-art hybrid
                switched-capacitor DC-DC converter. This research helped me
                sharpen my skills in analog circuit blocks like gate drivers,
                level shifters, and dead-time generators, while also improving
                my simulation and modeling capabilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Prior to my thesis, I worked as a Research Intern, focusing on
                automation in analog layout. I explored MAGICAL, an open-source
                analog layout generator, and worked on porting a design in TSMC
                65nm technology to this platform — gaining valuable experience
                in design rule translation and layout generation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before pursuing my Master’s, I spent four years as a Physical
                Design Engineer, contributing to multiple successful tapeouts. I
                began my career at AMD, where I worked on block-level designs at
                TSMC 7nm technology. I later joined MediaTek, contributing to
                projects across nodes ranging from 55nm down to 5nm. My
                responsibilities included the full flow from netlist to GDSII,
                with a strong emphasis on meeting timing, area, and power goals.
                I also had the opportunity to lead multiple blocks to tapeout,
                further strengthening my project ownership and technical
                leadership skills.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the years, I’ve developed a strong ability to work under
                pressure, manage tight deadlines, and adapt quickly to new
                environments and challenges. One of the most defining decisions
                of my career was leaving a full-time job to pursue higher
                education — a step that not only expanded my technical skill set
                but also helped me grow personally by working and studying
                across different countries and cultures.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am now eager to apply this blend of academic and professional
                experience to real-world design challenges, and I remain
                committed to continuous learning and pushing the boundaries of
                what’s possible in semiconductor technology.
